# auralink-ekd
This project is for developing hardware, firmware and software for a system that forwards ham radio shortwave signals received from an antenna to data processing systems in the Internet. A trademark "AuraLink EKD" has been registered as an identification to all work that will be contributed from interested developers and radio amateurs, hopefully.
